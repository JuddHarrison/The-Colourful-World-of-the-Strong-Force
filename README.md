# The_colourful_world
The colourful world of the strong force is a 3D printable set of particle physics toys designed to teach children (and enthusiastic adults) about quarks, the fundamental particles that make up protons, neutrons and the many other composite hadrons seen at experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider.

The files provided are in 3MF format, ready for slicing and exporting to G-code, and should be printed using red, green and blue filaments corresponding to their file names. Depending on your 3D printer setup, you may or may not need to include supports.

The connections include holes which should allow for press fitting 2mmx2mm cylindrical neodymium magnets. These can be a bit tricky to get in at first, but once you have a magnet in a male connector this can be used as a jig to hold a magnet for insertion into a matching female connection and vice versa (a small rubber mallet makes this process much easier in my experience). Though the press fittings are reasonably tight, due to variations in tolerance between 3D printers I advise also using an adhesive, such as a cyanoacrylate "super glue".

The "vertex" pieces also require gluing together - these must be done in the following combinations if the toys are to correspond to physical hadrons:

- 3 female connectors, all different colours, in a "Y" shape.

- 3 male connectors, all different colours, in a "Y" shape.

- 1 male connector and 1 female connector of the same colour together with 1 male connector and 1 female connector of the same colour in a tetrahedral shape.

finally, there are pieces which look similar to hose connectors. These are to allow for more complicated connections to be assembled, and require suitable lengths of hose to be pressed on, with a male piece at one end and a female piece of the same colour at the other end. I have opted for 7mmID silicone hoses, as these seem to be easy to source in red, green and blue.
