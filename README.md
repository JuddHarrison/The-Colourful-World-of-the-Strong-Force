# The_colourful_world
The colourful world of the strong force is a 3D printable set of particle physics toys designed to teach children (and enthusiastic adults) about quarks, the fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons.

The files provided are in 3MF format, ready for slicing and exporting to G-code. Depending on your 3D printer setup, you may or may not need to include supports.

The connections include holes which should allow for press fitting 2mmx2mm cylindrical neodymium magnets. These can be a bit trick to get in at first, but once you have a magnet in a male connector this can be used as a jig to hold a magnet for insertion into a matching female connection. Though the press fittings are reasonable tight, due to variations in tolerance between 3D printers I would advise also using an adhesive, such as a cyanoacrylate "super glue".

The connector pieces also require gluing together - these must be done in the following combinations if they are to correspond to physical quarks:

3 female connectors, all different colours, in a "Y" shape.
3 male connectors, all different colours, in a "Y" shape.

1 male connector and 1 female connector of the same colour together with 1 male connector and 1 female connector of the same colour in a tetrahedral shape.
